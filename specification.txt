The Club

Deadline is on Wednesday, 24:00. I won't check any code send to me after this
(I have to respect my private time, at least a bit).
________________________________________________________________________________

The Club
It's yet another club in London. Tickets are awfully expensive, and drinks are 
not cheap. There is terribly long queue, with staff fucking around and trying to
keep the queue ordered by their secret standards (which are not known to people
in the queue), and drug dealers trying to sell as much as they can, and policemen trying 
to catch dealers, and staff trying to earn some money, and VIPs don't giving a fuck. 

There are three places where people are - the club, the queue and the mob.
People can move from from the mob to the queue, from the 
queue to the club, and from the queue to the mob. 

________________________________________________________________________________

Rules of the club:
1. There can be only `m` people at the same time.
2. Ratio of women to men cannot be lower than 1 : 1 (there have to be more
 women than men).
3. VIPs can get into the club without waiting in the queue (as long as the first
 two rules are being met)
4. There can be only `o` Drug Dealers in the club.
5. There can be only `p` members of staff (ignoring first two rules, and this is
the only case when the first two rules can be broken). 
6. Only people below certain age limit, and older than 18 can get to the club.
(age limit can change, and again it doesn't affect staff)
7. Policeman (not Policewoman) can never get to the club. (He will be moved to 
 the mob. She can get in :D)

Rules of the queue:
1. There can be only `n` people in the queue at the same time, all the rest have 
to wait in the mob.
2. A person can only get to the club if he/she wouldn't break any of club's rules.
3. Drug Dealer can not be the first in the queue.
4. There can not be more than 3 people of same gender in the first three places in the queue.
5. If rule 5 is broken, the next person of opposite gender, should be moved to
 the third place in the queue.
6. Three person at the time try to move from the queue to the club.
7. If a policeman (of both genders) gets a place next to a Drug Dealer, both 
 the policeman and the drug dealer, are removed from the queue. (one caught 
 the other, unless the other bribed the first) //it happens during position updating not ticking, ticking is about the club
8. VIPs are moved to the beginning of the queue.

Rules of the mob: 
1. At the same time five people are moved from the mob to the queue, no more, no less.

If nothing can be done, nothing happens.
If someone has a chance to get to the club but is violating any of the rules, 
 he/she is moved to the mob.
Moving from the queue to the club, and from the mob to the queue is not the same
as entering the club or entering the queue.

WTD?
Your task is to simulate the queue, the club, and the mob, and print to output
 messages according to events. You can modify provided files however you want,
but your output must be the same as mine.

1. Write class Fiver, which should be a template, and should store five 
objects of the same type. Method get(n) should return reference to n-th object.
 - it will be used to pass poeple from the mob to the queue.

2. Write class DateTime, which will store current time. 
 - Constructor should take string as an argument - "dd/mm/yyyy hh:mm:ss"
 - Should also have function printDateTime(), which returns date and time in the same format as above

3. Write class Person and write subclass for every type of person
 - define enum Gender
 - types: Policeman, Drug Dealer, Client, Staff, VIP

4. Write class Event, which will hold information parsed from input.

5. Write class Club.

6. Write class Mob.

7. Write class Queue.

8. Finish clubMain.cpp 
 - read in data
 - check if your output is correct
 - check for memory leaks (Valgrind --tool=memcheck ./clubMain < example.in)
 - remove all the debugging/temporary code
 - write comments
 - check everything again

9. Send
10. Pray.
